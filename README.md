**Full Stack Junior Developer**

I have been interested in tech from a young age; I was lucky enough to have a nerdy dad and have taken after him, and treasure the spark/encouragement he gave me.  I was all geared up to have a career in tech, but during my A-Levels chose to go into Social Care instead.  However, it took experiencing a tragic situation at work to make me realise that there is no time to waste in this life and you need to go after the things you're passionate about, so I made the decision to return to my original calling - tech.

I am loyal, seriously hard working, set high standards for whatever job I do, am able to work well with others, and most importantly I love bringing laughter to the people I work with.  I am looking for a role that will challenge me to keep learning, and to work for a company that values the wellbeing of it's employees.

### Skills

**Communication**

I believe that my most valuable and transferable skill is my ability to communicate with people.  I have over a decade's experience of working alongside professionals from various organisations, and in a variety of settings.  This includes attending multiagency case discussions, giving reports at Child Protection Meetings and attending court hearings to advocate for young people.   

**Working under pressure & being able to prioritise workloads**

My previous roles required working with individuals and families at the point of crisis.  I am used to working within strict timescales; information gathering; making detailed assessments; prioritising complex needs to be fulfilled by limited budgets and negotiating best outcomes with a range of supporting organisations.  I am able to analyse information and situations easily and have strong communication skills which Iâ€™m able to apply to a diverse range of people.

**Creative Thinker**

During the final project we wanted the parent to be able to confirm once a chore had been completed, but were faced with the issue that the Alexa system doesn't have voice recognition.  I implemented a pin code system so that each time a chore was created, a random 4 digit number was generated; this was only ever visible on the parent's phone and had to be said to Alexa when confirming a chore was complete.
