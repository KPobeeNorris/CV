**Web Developer**

I am a Housing Support worker turned developer who cares about having a positive impact on the end-user’s life, and enjoys working with others to find creative solutions to challenges faced.  I am loyal, seriously hard working, set high standards for whatever job I do, am able to work well with others; and most importantly I love bringing laughter to the people I work with.  I am looking for a role where I can continue to develop my skills, to be part of building things that change people's lives, and want to work for a company that cares for it's staff's wellbeing.

### Skills

**Communication**

I believe that one of my key transferable skills is my ability to communicate with people.  I have over a decade's experience of working alongside professionals from various organisations, and in a variety of settings.  This includes attending multiagency case discussions, giving reports at Child Protection Meetings and attending court hearings to advocate for young people.  Whilst at Makers there was a focus on pair programming and this allowed me to work collaboratively with a wide range of people and develop the skills needed to make this success such as actively listening and swapping navigator/driver roles regularly. 

**Working under pressure & being able to prioritise workloads**

My previous roles required working with individuals and families at the point of crisis.  I am used to working within strict timescales; information gathering; making detailed assessments; prioritising complex needs to be fulfilled by limited budgets and negotiating best outcomes with a range of supporting organisations.  I am able to analyse information and situations easily and have strong communication skills which I’m able to apply to a diverse range of people.

**Creative Thinker**

Working in a Social Care environment means designing tailored plans for each client and negotiating the best outcomes for them.  There were often limited resources and a range of professionals who had to fulfil their own criterial; this meant a focus on being able to come up with creative solutions that balanced everyone's needs/pressures.  In addition to this, during our final project at Makers we were faced with the issue that the Alexa system doesn't have voice recognition, so I implemented a pin code system that generated a security code for each chore.

### Blurb

I have been interested in tech from a young age; I was lucky enough to have a nerdy dad and have taken after him.  Whilst planning on a career in tech during my school years, I did some volunteering one summer and took the opportunity to start a career in Social Care instead.  I loved that in Social Care you never knew what each day was going to bring you, even if you thought you had a plan in place! As a developer the excitement comes from knowing that the code I write is having a positive impact for users, and that I'll never stop learning.

- My big life achievement was travelling and working around Australia and New Zealand for 18 months.
- I love gaming, binge watching great tv shows and enjoy a few ends of bowls.
