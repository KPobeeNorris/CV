**Junior Developer - Full Stack**

I have been interested in tech from a young age; I was lucky enough to have a nerdy dad and have taken after him.  My education was geared towards a career in tech, but during my A-levels I chose to go down the Social care route instead as wanted to support those in crisis.  I had been trying to get up the courage to switch to a career in tech for a while, but it took experiencing a tragic situation at work to make me realise that there is no time to waste in this life and you need to go after the things you're passionate about.

I have spent over a decade years working in highly stressful situations providing advice and support to young people with complex needs, and learnt the value of working in a team to effectively provide services.  My default setting is laughter and firmly believe that having fun at work also makes us better at our jobs.  I am also loyal and set high standards for myself in whatever job I do.  I would love an opportunity to be part of a company that values their staff, and would support me to develop my skills even further, so that I can be a valuable member of the team.

### Skills

In my last job I held the role of a Housing and Support Worker for a Local Authority, where my role included:

- Assessing young people aged 16-25 who presented as homeless, or at risk of homelessness, and with other complex needs e.g. mental health issues, substance misuse, experiencing/witnessing domestic violence, gang members, and so forth.  
- Working with families with the aim of returning young people home to their parents; where this was not possible then making recommendations as to where best to house them.
- Undertaking joint assessments with Children's Services where appropriate, and liaising with multiple agencies to ensure safeguarding and relevant information sharing.

This experience enabled me to develop a unique set of skills that I know will be beneficial in my future role.   

**Communication**

I believe that my most valuable and transferable skill is my ability to communicate with people.  I have experience of working alongside professionals from various organisations, and in a variety of settings.  This involved attending meetings at differing levels, from a case discussion, to Child Protection conferences, and to attending court to advocate for a young person.  There was also the crucial skill in assessing young people's needs, where you wanted to get important information that they may be reluctant to share.  This put an emphasis on quickly building rapport, adapting questions to how the person presented to you, and rapidly being able to use the information provided to work out a list of prioritised actions to ensure the best possible outcome for that young person.  

**Working under pressure & being able to prioritise workloads**

By law any 16 or 17 year old who walked into the office, and told us they were homeless, were not allowed to leave unless we knew they had somewhere to stay that night.  Young people could present at any time, including 5 minutes before the office closed, but the outcome had to be the same; find them somewhere to stay.  Initially it was crucial to gather as much information as possible from the young person to assess their situation and then establish somewhere for them to stay for at least a night; this meant contacting their families, various agencies, including Children's Services, to locate bed spaces.  Once they had somewhere to stay it was then down to me to check my workload to prioritise the assessment of that young person.  It was crucial that I remained calm, and focused during these times, to get the best outcome for each client.
