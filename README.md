**Web Developer**

I have been interested in tech from a young age; I was lucky enough to have a nerdy dad and have taken after him, and treasure the spark/encouragement he gave me.  I was all geared up to have a career in tech, but during my A-Levels chose to go into Social Care instead.  However, it took experiencing a tragic situation at work to make me realise that there is no time to waste in this life and you need to go after the things you're passionate about, so I made the decision to return to my original calling - tech.

I am loyal, seriously hard working, set high standards for whatever job I do, am able to work well with others, and most importantly I love bringing laughter to the people I work with.  I am looking for a role that will challenge me to keep learning, and to work for a company that values the wellbeing of it's employees.

### Skills

**Communication**

Working in Social Care I developed skills that enable me to:

* Work in partnership with professionals from a wide range of disciplines;
* Complete comprehensive assessments of service user needs and gathering information from them, their family members and other professional agencies;
* Regularly chair meetings with service users and professionals to get the best outcome for the client.

At Makers I worked effectively in team and pair programming settings and was able to:

* Support my pair and team members by breaking down ideas and problems through discussion and diagramming;
* Be supportive and create an environment where everyone could share their ideas;
* Work collaboratively with my pair and regularly switch between driving and navigating roles.

**Working under pressure & being able to prioritise workloads**

In my previous career I worked with clients at a point of crisis, requiring me to:

* Work within strict timescales for completing assessments;
* Prioritise the complex needs of clients and make appropriate referrals to partner agencies.

During the project weeks at Makers we:

* Held regular stand-ups and retros;
* Used Waffle to support us in managing our issues, achieve our MVP and manage our work flow effectively.

**Creative Thinker**

Working in a Social Care environment means designing tailored plans for each client by:

* Prioritising clientsâ€™ needs to be fulfilled by limited budgets;
* Negotiating best outcomes with a range of supporting organisations who have differing criteria.

During our final project at Makers we were faced with the issue that the Alexa system doesn't have voice recognition, so I implemented a pin code system that generated a security code for each chore.
